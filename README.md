# my-portfolio

A simple portfolio template to showcase my work.

This is the first in a series of "CRUD-A-DAY" projects in which I create a single full-stack application with full persistent CRUD capabilities every day until I forget. Ideally these all showcase an individual web development concept or feature.

This project was spun up with Strapi.

To run the development server:
npm run develop
